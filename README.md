# Web Development Project 2 - *Flash Cards*

Submitted by: **Damaris Campos**

This web app: **This web app is a flashcard game that challenges users to identify Pokémon based on a question prompt. It displays a card with a question and an accompanying image, allowing users to toggle between the question and the answer. The app includes navigation for users to cycle through different Pokémon flashcards, with features for categorizing difficulty visually. The user interface is designed to be engaging and interactive, making it an enjoyable learning tool for Pokémon enthusiasts.**

## Notes

While building the app, I faced challenges with the layout and styling of the flashcards, particularly ensuring the image was positioned correctly beneath the question without overflowing. Additionally, managing state for the current index and toggling the answer visibility required careful tracking to ensure a smooth user experience. Implementing the dynamic styling based on difficulty categories also posed challenges, as it necessitated coordination between the data structure and the visual representation.
